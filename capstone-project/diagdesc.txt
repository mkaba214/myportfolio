Step 1
The developer makes changes to the application code using an AWS supported IDE.

Step 2
The developer commits code changes and pushes the code to an AWS CodeCommit Git repository.

Step 3
When changes are made to the code repository in CodeCommit, it initiates the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline set up in AWS CodePipeline.

Step 4
CodePipeline invokes the AWS CodeBuild Unit test project to perform unit testing on the code.

Step 5
After the Unit test project is completed, the CodeBuild Build image project is invoked.

Step 6
The CodeBuild Build image project builds a container image from the code, tags the image, and pushes it to Amazon ECR.

Step 7
The final stage of the pipeline is invoked, which is the CodeBuild Deploy app project.

Step 8
The CodeBuild Deploy app project deploys the container image from Amazon ECR to the Amazon EKS cluster.
